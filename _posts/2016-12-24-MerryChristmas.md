  I'm sitting here in my office while my wife and mother-in-law are out shopping for last minute holiday foodstuffs.  While they were out, I decided to go for a walk and hatch a few eggs, since the Pokemon Go holiday event started today.  In the rainy New England coldness, I got a Drowzee from a 5k egg, but I've still got a few more eggs to hatch with Mrs. Norseman when she returns.  I also got some really awesome pictures and video footage of the rain at the pond nearby too.  I'll try to upload that next time perhaps.

  So yeah, this is a blog style thing, where I'm collecting my thoughts for the day.  It will be random, it will be stream of consciousness.  There will be soapboxes and rants.  But all in all, I'm doing this for myself as a way to see where I am, where I'm going, and where I've been.  This may or not be successful, but who knows.
</p>
<p>
  I'm really thankful for where I am in life. I have a wonderful wife, as stable of a job as I can get; I'm in school, have a great group of friends (both online and off), and support for all of my crazy endeavors.  I can't, and shouldn't complain, no matter if the world is messed up in ways that seem beyond my reasoning.
</p>
<p>
  But, as a normal person, I will still complain about things as a way to vent.  It's what we do.  It's not a focus, it's just what it is.

Happy Holidays
