  <b>I have no clue what I'm doing</b>
</p>
<p>
  Another Christmas come and gone.  Much like my last post, I've got nothing to complain about, but I still feel like I'm floating.  I'm surrounded by love and warmth, but I still can't seem to shake the negative feelings that seem to be accompanying me today (and for the past few days).  I'm putting on a face though.  I don't want to drag anyone down this holiday.  If I smile enough, I might be left along enough to have time to figure out what the fuck is wrong with me this time.
</p>
<p>
  I hope everyone is having a great time though!  I really wish nothing but happiness and warmth for everyone.  If you're feeling down, try to understand it, and talk to someone about it, someone close who cares.  I'm having a rough time, sure, but it's not the end of the world.  I will bounce back from this.  I always do, and so do you.

<p>
  All will be well.
